# ReliableDataProtocol

A collaborative project creating a basic reliable data protocol for the network application layer, for a router in the GINI network simulation tool. This was acheived by extending the capacities of transport-layer protocol UDP, and was used as an opportunity to deploy some basic concurrent programming skills such as locking variables and utilizing threads to keep tabs on timers. Completed as an assignment for a computer networks course.
